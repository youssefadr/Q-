Certainly! If you're focusing solely on the Q* implementation without incorporating the A* algorithm as part of the PyTorch repository, the README can be adjusted to reflect this focus. Here's an updated template:

Q* Implementation in PyTorch
Introduction
This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the Q* algorithm, as described in the paper "A* Search without Expansions: Learning Heuristic Functions with Deep Q-Networks". Q* is a novel algorithm that utilizes Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to learn heuristic functions, thereby improving efficiency in pathfinding and search tasks.

Background
The Q* algorithm represents a significant advancement in heuristic search algorithms, combining the principles of reinforcement learning and heuristic optimization. It is designed to reduce the computational complexity commonly associated with traditional search algorithms.
